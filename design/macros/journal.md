# Macros as rules: journal

## Reflective inquiry

|  | Understanding | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| **Status** | Tonk's forms get their meaning in a Rust parser and analyzer, with `rule!` and `concept!` special-cased. Dialog stores rules under the hash of their descriptor and stores no concepts or names. The new notation on #728 is unimplemented. | **Diagnosing.** The feature is stated nine ways. The problem is not stated. |
| **Agenda** | Which of the four candidate problems below is in the way, and for whom. What "primitive form" means, since it is used for two things. Whether a space, and not only dialog, may add a form. | Delimit: one paragraph with no remedy in it. Then Direction, with the parked approaches as columns. |

## Candidate problems

"Macros as rules" is one possible answer. These are the problems it could be an answer to. Each is a hypothesis in the [ledger](claims.md) until evidence or the maintainer says otherwise.

1. **A form costs a release.** Adding `view` or `event`, or changing what `concept` takes, means changing a parser and an analyzer in Rust and shipping them. A space cannot add a form of its own.
2. **A definition's meaning is in code, not in data.** What `concept` or `rule` takes is known to the analyzer and to an 831-line guide. An agent or a tool cannot ask the database what forms exist and what each one takes.
3. **A definition's meaning can move after it is written.** A stored form that refers to something by name means something else once the name is re-pointed.
4. **Two builds may read one document two ways.** What a stored form means depends on the analyzer that reads it, and replicas do not all run the same build.

## Approaches parked for Direction

Not examined yet. They are columns, not recommendations.

- **Status quo.** A parser and compiler in Rust know every form (tonk-notation today; the `dialog-notation` crate #728 plans).
- **Everything is a rule** (Irakli). Macros are rules, and the compiler is a rule too.
- **Macros are rules, compiling is a formula** (Irakli). Rules turn a surface form into kernel forms; one built-in formula turns a kernel form into what dialog stores.
- **Macros are data, expanding is built in** (the 2026-05-16 journal). A macro is a stored pattern and templates; a native expander applies them. No rule takes part.

## 2026-11-10, Diagnosing: from "macros as rules" to what is in the way

**Asked.**

- Irakli brought the list in the [topic's description](../macros.md#description), and asked: is the compiler itself a rule, or is there a built-in formula that takes syntax and compiles it?
- The agent's answer, as a hypothesis (H1 in the ledger): both, split at the kernel form. Three reasons the compiler cannot be a rule all the way down. Something has to compile the first rule. A rule's identity comes from a canonical labeling that searches (colour refinement, then individualisation), which is not a deduction. And a rule that does not match says nothing, where a compiler has to say why a form was refused.
- Open, asked of Irakli: which of the four candidate problems is in the way today, and what happens because of it.

**Learned.**

- "All primitive forms are expressed through macro rules" and "macros are rules" cannot both hold all the way down: `rule` would be defined by a rule. Irakli's own follow-up, the built-in formula, is where the regress stops. The word "primitive" was carrying two meanings; the [glossary](glossary.md) splits it into surface form and kernel form.
- Earlier readings by the agent in this conversation were off the mark and are withdrawn: conduct as the host language, and a meta-circular evaluator with bindings threaded through premises. Neither is in the maintainer's notes.
- The 2026-05-16 design had no problem assembling a form from rows, because its macros expanded to triples. The problem appeared on #728 when a definition became one value under its hash. H4 says a set-collecting `reduce` closes it.

**Decided.** Not decided. What would decide the phase: Irakli's answer to the open question, written into the Problem section.

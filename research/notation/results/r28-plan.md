# R28 plan: does one sentence fix the rename misreading?

Written and committed before any reader ran. The tally will be in `r28.md` beside it.

## Why

In [R27](r27.md) all 20 readers said renaming a to-do derived from an issue does nothing: they read rule B's `(xyz.todo ?t title: ?old)` as stored facts only. Dialog reads a field by its values, stored or derived, so rule B fires, the new title is stored, and the to-do shows it; the maintainer expects exactly that. Making domain calls stored-only is not an option, because a concept that reads a subset of a derived concept's fields must see what the rule derives. So the fix is to say it. This round tests whether one sentence is enough.

## Variants

| variant | readers | document |
|---|---|---|
| `stated` | 10 | R27's `bare` document, with one sentence of documentation: a domain call such as `(xyz.todo ?t title: ?x)` reads every value of that field, whether it was stored or derived by a rule |
| `control` | 5 | R27's `bare` document, unchanged (sha256 `b682e1b73bb7777e`), to check R27's result holds on the day |

## Scoring

The main item is question 8. Its point goes to a reader who says the to-do `issue:7` shows "Fix login bug" and the issue keeps "Fix login".

Question 9's expected answer is "Login fails". Items 1 to 5, 7 and 10 are scored as in R27, to see that the sentence breaks nothing.

## Bars

`haiku`, read-only, all started at once, interleaved.

- The sentence works if at least 7 of the 10 `stated` readers score question 8.
- It is no help if 2 or fewer do.
- `control` is expected to score question 8 at most once in 5, as R27's 20 readers scored it none. If it scores more, R27's result does not hold on the day, and that is reported before anything else.

Below is code in a notation you have not seen before. Its only documentation is one sentence: a domain call such as `(xyz.todo ?t title: ?x)` reads every value of that field, whether it was stored or derived by a rule. Otherwise answer from the code alone, saying what you think it does. Give a short reason with every answer. Answer every question, numbered.

## The code

```clj
(concept (todo ?t title: ?title status: ?status)
  (xyz.todo ?t title: (last ?title as: :text)
               status: (last ?status as: [:open :done])))

(concept (issue ?i title: ?title state: ?state)
  (xyz.tracker ?i title: (last ?title as: :text)
                  state: (last ?state as: :text)))

; A
(rule (todo ?i title: ?x status: :open)
  (issue ?i title: ?x state: "open"))

; B
(rule (update-title (todo ?t) old: ?old new: ?new)
  (rename (todo ?t) title: ?new)
  (xyz.todo ?t title: ?old))

; C
(rule (retract (xyz.todo ?t title: ?old))
  (update-title (todo ?t) old: ?old))

; D
(rule (assert (xyz.todo ?t title: ?new))
  (update-title (todo ?t) new: ?new))
```

These facts are stored, and nothing else:

```text
todo:1   xyz.todo/title     "Buy milk"
todo:1   xyz.todo/status    :open
issue:7  xyz.tracker/title  "Fix login"
issue:7  xyz.tracker/state  "open"
```

## Questions

1. For each of the rules A, B, C and D, which part is its conclusion and which parts are its conditions?
2. What does rule A do? Is the to-do it gives stored?
3. A document holds only `(query (todo ?t title: ?x))`. What does it give back?
4. The issue's state is changed to "closed". What does the same query give back now?
5. With the issue open again, a document holds `(rename (todo todo:1) title: "Buy oat milk")`. Walk through what each rule does. Is `update-title` stored?
6. Do the retract and the assert from question 5 take effect at once, in the same step as the rename, or later? Why?
7. Once question 5's document has taken full effect, what does `(query (todo todo:1 title: ?x))` give back? Is "Buy milk" still stored?
8. Instead, a document holds `(rename (todo issue:7) title: "Fix login bug")`. Afterwards, what title does the to-do `issue:7` show, and what is the issue's title?
9. After question 8, the issue's title is changed to "Login fails". What title does the to-do `issue:7` show now?
10. Write rules in this notation so that `(archive (note ?n))` removes the note's text, stored as `xyz.note/text`, and stores the same text as `xyz.archive/text` on the same entity.
11. Rate how readable this notation is from 1 to 5, and name the one thing you found hardest to guess.

# Information Model

The information model in Dialog has two parts:

1. **Attributes** - The vocabulary of facts (name, salary, manager)
2. **Concepts** - Interpretations of groups of facts

Attributes give semantic meaning to the "the" part of relations. They're labels with metadata (type, cardinality) but don't constrain what facts you can assert.

Concepts are patterns for interpreting entities - they describe how to make sense of groups of related facts.

Let's start by defining attributes.
